# 🎬 SQL Movie Recommender System

> A beginner-friendly project to filter and recommend movies using SQL-style logic in Python.  
> Built with Pandas + Google Colab — no setup needed!

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **SQL-style movie recommendation engine** using Python and `pandas`.  
Users can upload or define a custom movie dataset and run SQL-like queries such as:

- Filter by genre, rating, or title
- Recommend high-rated or matching movies
- Practice data manipulation without writing SQL syntax

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Search by title, genre, or keywords  
- 📊 Filter movies by IMDb rating  
- 🧠 Get movie suggestions with similar genres  
- 💡 Learn `pandas` as a SQL alternative  
- 🛠️ Zero installations — works in Google Colab
